Synopsis

This is project is my first attempt to play with API using Ajax and JSON. This project presents different search possibilities using Ajax ( and OMDB API ). 


Code Explanation

The app allows for a general search returning all movies/series that has a matching word this means the API will return various results. The other possibility, pulls movie by title and this search pulls 1 movie only. Note that buttons disappear after each search to allow only for a new search to be made.

I have also a onkey up search functionality to further enhance the ajax call capabilities. I have set some timeout to delay the onkey speed of action. Now a user may enter a movie title with ease without getting results being returned after the second letter is entered. Also added .trim() to get rid of whitespace before and after the movie title.
