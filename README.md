Synopsis

This is project is my first attempt to play with API using Ajax and JSON.


Code Explanation

The app allows for a general search returning all movies/series that has a matching word this means the API will return various results. The other possibility, pulls movie by title and this search pulls 1 movie only. Note that buttons disappear after each search to allow only for a new search to be made.


API Reference
